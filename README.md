Hiya👋, I'm Raman Sinclair, a software engineer with many years of experience in WebDev. 

- I'm passionate about Open Source and Open Data 👨‍💻:
- - my favourite projects include: [MusicBrainz](https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-server), [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org), [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org), [Unicode](https://home.unicode.org) and many more.
- in my work I focus a lot on quality and performance; the productivity is important, but it's secondary;

- I prefer Cats🐈;
- I'm currently freelancing, but I welcome offers;
